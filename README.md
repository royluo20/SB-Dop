Predicting risk levels for common diseases


Welcome to SB-DOP, the survey-based disease outcome prediction! 
We are a group of students from Brown and Columbia. We worked on the 
development of a prediction model based on a short survey consisted of 
commonly asked health-related questions that can help people be aware
of their potential risk levels of common diseases. At the end of the survey,
you will be able to view the plots of where you stand compared to the American
population for the selected list of diseases.
